# MPS Maven Plugin
`mps-maven-plugin` generates code from [JetBrains MPS](http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) models created using MPS language
plugins for IntelliJ IDEA. The plugin does not require MPS to be installed on the machine and thus helps integrate MPS
into Maven-based continuous integration builds.

**PRE-RELEASE NOTE:** The project is currently pre-release software with unstable interfaces until we figure out what
the best way is to package artifacts, how dependencies should be specified, what the most often encountered usage
scenarios are, and so on. Everything may change until then.

See the [documentation site](http://jetbrains.github.io/mps-maven-plugin) for usage instructions and reference.
